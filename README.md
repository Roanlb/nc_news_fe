# NC News Front End

This is a news and discussion website and my front end review project for Northcoders. Through the site you can view news articles by topic, up or down vote them, post and delete your own comments and up or down vote comments. The site will also give an error page if you navigate to a non-existent article or topic.

## Getting started

The github repository for this project can be cloned with the terminal command 'git clone https://github.com/Roanlb/nc_news_fe.git'. Once this is done, run the command 'cd nc_news_fe'. Then, the required dependencies can be installed with the command 'npm i bootstrap react axios @reach/router'. Once this is done 'npm start' can be entered to begin viewing a local version. Node version 13.1.0 is required to do this.

## Deployed version

A hosted version of the front end site can be found online at https://wizardly-khorana-ad28c0.netlify.com/.

## Built with

- Reach Router: used to conditionally render components via endpoints (this is a single page application)
- Axios: used to make http requests to the back end
- React: used to add ECMAScript logic to HTML elements
- Bootstrap: used to add styling

## Back end
