# NC News Front End

This is a news and discussion website and my front end review project for Northcoders.

## Getting started

The github repository for this project can be cloned with the command 'git clone https://github.com/Roanlb/nc_news_fe.git'. Once this is done, the required dependencies can be installed with the command 'npm i react axios @reach/router'. Once this is done 'npm start' can be entered to begin viewing a local version.

## Built with

-Reach Router: used to conditionally render components via endpoints (this is a single page application)
-Axios: used to make http requests to the back end
-React: used to add ECMAScript logic to HTML elements

## Back end

The code for the back end API for this project can be found at https://github.com/Roanlb/nc_news_be. This API is hosted online and can be accessed at https://roanncnewsserver.herokuapp.com/api.
